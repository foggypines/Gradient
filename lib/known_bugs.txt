-When using multiple inputs into point (and likely others) the last updated input gets priority which can cause outputs to change (likely fixed but further testing needed)
-Deleting a node does not always delete it's geometry (Mostly fixed but needs work on union)
-Node union compute code needs to be updated to allow multiple input bodies to be unioned
-Nodes that generate a BReP need a more helpful output other than the guid which is what they currently use
